# MMDAgentAlexaST

## Overview & Thanks

The Holy Grail. An Avatar brought to life for Alexa to have a presence! (If only in rooms with a monitor :), until 3D holograms arrive).

Well, this is Alexa interface work was started by Jianming Liu (https://github.com/jianmliu) based on the MMDAgent Avatar system, which he is developing for Raspary Pi interfaces. So, if you want to have Pi solutions for Alexa, please keep following Jiang Liu's excellent work. MMDAgent is available for Windows and Android. It has a host of Manga fans on Deviant Art, who have created a number of characters, some are quite good. For the more main stream world audience, I imagine we will have to go for a more mature, older looking Alexa, who can be left responsibly in charge of our homes. That said, I am standing on the shoulders of giants, taking their great works on a new tangent, hopefully.

This project is for a SmartThings interface from Alexa to SmartThings and back out to MMDAgent as the Anouncement device. From my present reading and understanding, this will most likely have to make use of the two way streams from SmartThings to Alexa building on the fabulous Ask Alexa interface created by Michael Struck (https://github.com/MichaelStruck).

Much more to follow over the coming months......
