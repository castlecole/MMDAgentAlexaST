# STAlexa-Avatar

## Overview & Thanks

The Holy Grail. An Avatar to create a visual virtual presence for Alexa, as she tries to make the management of our homes more human.

Well, this a little based on the Alexa interface work started by [Jianming Liu](https://github.com/jianmliu), who has used an MMDAgent Avatar system, which he is developing for Raspberry Pi interfaces (Read his article about Alexa and the Snowboy agent in the [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/jianmliu/what-if-alexa-has-an-avatar-27a055). So, if you want to have Raspberry Pi solutions for Alexa, please keep following Jianming Liu's excellent work.

MMDAgent is available for Windows via the developers website, [MMDAgent](http://www.mmdagent.jp/) the Nagoya Institute of Technology, where there is a link to the source code on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmdagent). Also available for Android via partner developers...{ ToDo } It has a host of Manga fans on [Deviant Art](), who have created a number of characters, some are quite good. For the more main stream world audience, I imagine we will have to go for a more mature, older looking Alexa, who can be left responsibly in charge of our homes. That said, I am standing on the shoulders of giants here, taking their great works (both artistic and code creative) on a new tangent, hopefully.

This project is for a SmartThings interface from Alexa to SmartThings and back out to MMDAgent as the Anouncement device. From my present reading and understanding, this will most likely have to make use of the two way streams from SmartThings to Alexa building on the fabulous Ask Alexa interface created by [Michael Struck](https://github.com/MichaelStruck).

Much more to follow over the coming months...... more specifically, instructions on how to make anything here actually work.

In the meantime, I have started a Tutorial Readme in this folder on the basics of the setup and use of the MMDAgent:
